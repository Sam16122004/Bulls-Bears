          <font size="3">Space mining is the collection of raw
            materials from their natural location, which is
            allowable under the Outer space Treaty. These
            materials can be reduced to possession, sale, trade,
            exploration, or scientific pursuits. The ores,
            stones, and even gaseous products are all found in
            the space mines. There are around 16,000 asteroids
            in the Earth’s orbit, and it holds approximately 2
            trillion tones of water and many rich minerals and
            metals. All these materials are essential for us.
            The first space mining project was executed in 2016
            by NASA. It involved the launch of the OSIRIS-Rex
            rover to the nearby asteroid Bennu, collecting the
            samples, and bringing them back to Earth. The total
            cost of the project was around 1.16 billion dollars.</font>

              are no rules that restrict the use of these resources. Green energy contributes to 28% of total global
              energy. Also, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing year by year,
              contributing to global warming. To fight this situation, we have to mine the surface of the planets,
              asteroids, or celestial bodies to get the minerals, energy sources that will be useful for us in the

              minable areas (rich in resources) on the asteroid for mining. Then a space vehicle is launched that
              contains the mining machine and suitable container for samples. It reaches the targeted area and collects
              the resources. After extracting the mining samples in the container vessel, it returns to Earth. There are
              many challenges that we have to face when returning the samples. If the spacecraft gets damaged during
              landing, it may not successfully reach Earth. There are also difficulties in flying through the asteroid
